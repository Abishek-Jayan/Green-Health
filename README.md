## Inspiration
Growing up surrounded by gardens and with a family member experienced in maintaining them, I often struggled to identify different plants and care for them, especially when the resident gardener was away. I soon realized that many people faced similar challenges, so I decided to create an app to solve this problem.

## What it does
The app allows users to take pictures of unfamiliar plants and learn their names, scientific classifications, and optimal growing conditions.

## How we built it
I developed the app using Flutter and integrated Googleâ€™s Gemini LLM for image recognition.

## What we learned
This project was my first experience with both Flutter and the Gemini API. I learned how to develop a user-friendly UI in Flutter and effectively integrate the LLM for plant identification.
